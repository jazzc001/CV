[Portfolio](https://jasminecheung.netlify.app/)

I am a dedicated full-stack software engineer who carries logical thinking to overcome challenges, write fully tested and extensible codes as well as to build scalable apps. My backgrounds in both professional sports field and recruitment industry involve tremendous of decision making, team collaboration and planning works which built a solid ground of various soft skills including self-initiative, structural-learning and problem solving. 

Having recently completed an intensive 12 weeks of [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy), I have grown from an interested amateur coder into a competent and confident junior developer with fast learning skill to quickly ramp up on new technologies and domains.

I am currently looking to take on a career in the tech scene of London, where I can further expand my knowledge in Full-Stack and Back End development.

### **Team Collaborator** 
Cultivated in team sports for almost 2 decades, I value effective communication in requesting and receiving feedback. Applying those skills in the boot camp's projects, I have proactively acquired feedback from teammates and listened to their approaches to certain problems which have successfully come up with agreed solutions without escalating disagreements into conflicts. For example, before the project Sportify kicks off, we have a group meeting to get to know the way how they would like to receive feedback and the expectation of this project. During the development phase, we run regular standups to report progress and share blockers. Considering the time constraint, we agreed to scarify some fancy features, like connecting to Spotify API for a personalized song playlist to improve the user interface quality of the app, like a drop-down menu and creating a personalized exercise list.

### **Adaptability** 
I can adapt to high pressured and fast pace environments. Back in my time as a recruiter, I was promoted from junior consultant to team lead. I managed to keep hitting my deal records whilst coaching new joiners. Being adapted to greater responsibilities, I have expanded my pressure tank of organizing workloads. Moreover, as a professional athlete, I am committed to high-level performance sports which require a disciplined diet and a strict training schedule. This intensive training environment created a better version of myself and being able to push my limit and record further. I am proud to say I am an impact player on the field. I believe I can do so in the software engineering industry.

### **Initiative** 
I am a self-starter and always get prepared for what I want to achieve. During my time in the recruitment field, I was ambitious about growing my network and business. I have on-onboarded more than 30 clients in the first year and consistently converted to profitable deals which echoed the business’ commercial aims. After leaving the recruitment industry, I set my goal to be a software engineer. Thus, before Makers, I have familiarised myself with coding, and frameworks and got to understand how software developments work. By utilizing different resources, like Udemy, freecodecamp, CodeWar, Google, Stack-over-flow, Edx, etc., I learned the way to solve the problems. During Maker, I have proactively asked different questions in the class and read external resources to understand technical concepts, like SSH and HTTP protocols. After Maker, I am offered a temporary volunteer backend engineer position in Develop for Good. I stepped up to be a leader of the project with responsibilities including domain modelling, server setting, database modelling, and related packages choice.

### **Problem Solving and Attention to detail**
Having taken one of the hardest subjects, econometrics, in university, I am trained to solve the same problem with an analytical mindset. In the project Sportify, my main contribution was to set up the server and backend codes which involve RESTful API, database modelling, package installations, etc. I took into account time and space management on each code which made the app scalable and readable.
